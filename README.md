# Networking, Systems & Security Conference Deadlines

**üåê Live Site**: [https://amirrezaghafoori.github.io/nss-deadlines/](https://amirrezaghafoori.github.io/nss-deadlines/)

Countdown timers for academic conference deadlines targeted by the **Networks and Systems Security Lab (NSSL)**.

This project is forked from [Security and Privacy deadlines](https://github.com/sec-deadlines/sec-deadlines.github.io) project and customized for our lab's research focus areas.

## About This Project

This website tracks deadlines for **24 conferences** that are commonly targeted by researchers in the Networks and Systems Security Lab (NSSL). The conferences cover our main research areas:

- **Networking** - Top-tier networking conferences
- **Wireless** - Wireless and mobile systems conferences  
- **Systems** - Systems and distributed computing conferences
- **Security** - Security and privacy conferences
- **Top 4** - The most prestigious conferences in our field

## Conference Categories

Our conferences are organized into the following types:
- **NETWORKING** - Networking and communication protocols
- **WIRELESS** - Wireless, mobile, and IoT systems
- **SYSTEMS** - Operating systems, distributed systems, and computer architecture
- **SECURITY** - Security, privacy, and cryptography
- **TOP4** - The top-tier conferences (includes networking + security flagships)
- **CONF** - Conference venues (as opposed to workshops)

## Adding/Updating a Conference

Want to suggest a new conference or update existing information? We welcome contributions!

1. **Check the scope**: Ensure the conference aligns with NSSL's research areas (networking, wireless, systems, security)
2. **Update the data**: Modify `_data/conferences.yml` following the format below
3. **Submit a pull request**: Send us your changes for review

Please check if an entry for a prior year already exists and update it rather than creating a duplicate.

### Deadline Format

The *deadline* field should contain a list of deadlines in ISO format:

```yaml
deadline: ["2025-07-31 23:59"]  # Single deadline
```

```yaml
deadline:                       # Multiple deadlines
  - "2025-07-24 23:59"         # Abstract deadline
  - "2025-07-31 23:59"         # Paper deadline
```

All deadlines are automatically displayed in the viewer's local time.

*Note:* If the deadline hour is `{h}:00`, it will be automatically translated into `{h-1}:59:59` to avoid confusion when it happens to be midnight in local time.

### Timezone Codes

The timezone is specified in [tz format][1]. Here are some common codes:

| Common name                   | tz                                                                 |
